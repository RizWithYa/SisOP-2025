## 1.1 What are the three main purposes of an operating system?

1. **Manage computer resources**: The OS manages CPU time, memory, storage, and I/O devices.
2. **Provide a user interface**: It offers a convenient environment (command-line or GUI) for users to run and interact with programs.
3. **Execute and provide services for software**: The OS loads programs into memory, schedules their execution, and handles system calls.

## 1.2 When is it appropriate for the OS to "waste" resources, and why is it not truly wasteful?

- **Appropriate scenario**: When user convenience, ease of development, or responsiveness is more critical than absolute hardware efficiency. For example, modern systems often keep multiple programs in memory (even if not all are active) to allow for quick context switching.
- **Why it’s not truly wasteful**: The time or resources spent can improve overall system usability and productivity. Idle hardware resources (like CPU cycles) are common in modern systems, so using them for improved user experience or simpler abstractions often outweighs the strict efficiency cost.

## 1.3 Main difficulty in writing an OS for a real-time environment

- **Meeting strict timing constraints**: Real-time operating systems (RTOS) must guarantee that critical tasks complete within specified time bounds. The programmer has to design scheduling, interrupt handling, and resource management to ensure deadlines are always met.

## 1.4 Purpose of system calls, and five major categories with examples

- **Purpose**: System calls provide a controlled interface between user applications and the operating system. They allow user-level processes to request OS services (e.g., file I/O, process creation) in a safe and standardized way.

### Five major categories of system calls (with two examples each)

1. **Process Control**  
   - `fork()` / `CreateProcess()` – create a new process  
   - `exit()` – terminate a process  

2. **File Management**  
   - `open()` / `fopen()` – open a file  
   - `close()` – close a file  

3. **Device Management**  
   - `ioctl()` – control or configure a device  
   - `read()` / `write()` – read from/write to a device  

4. **Information Maintenance**  
   - `getpid()` – get the current process ID  
   - `time()` – get the system time  

5. **Communication**  
   - `pipe()` – create a pipe for interprocess communication  
   - `send()` / `recv()` (or `sendto()` / `recvfrom()`) – send/receive messages over a network

## 1.5 How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode act as rudimentary protection?

- **Dual-mode operation**: Hardware enforces two modes:  
  - **User mode**: Limited privileges; user applications run here to prevent accidental or malicious operations that could harm the system.  
  - **Kernel mode**: Full privileges; the OS runs in this mode to execute critical tasks (managing hardware, memory, and system resources).  
- **Protection mechanism**: Certain instructions and memory areas are only accessible in kernel mode, preventing user processes from performing harmful or unauthorized actions.

## 1.6 Which instructions should be privileged?

Let’s look at each instruction:

1. **Set value of timer** – **Privileged** (the OS uses the timer for preemption and scheduling).  
2. **Read the clock** – **Non-privileged** (safe for a user process to query time).  
3. **Clear memory** – **Privileged** (could affect overall system memory).  
4. **Issue a trap instruction** – **Non-privileged** (user processes use traps to request system services).  
5. **Turn off interrupts** – **Privileged** (disabling interrupts could halt system responsiveness).  
6. **Modify entries in device-status table** – **Privileged** (manipulates hardware resources).  
7. **Switch from user to kernel mode** – **Privileged** (controls transition to privileged mode).  
8. **Access I/O device** – **Privileged** (direct I/O access can affect the entire system).

## 1.7 Two difficulties in protecting the OS by locking it in a memory partition

1. **Lack of flexibility for OS updates**: The OS may need to patch or dynamically load modules. A strictly locked partition hinders updates or bug fixes.  
2. **Inability to expand**: As the OS evolves, it may require more memory. A rigid memory partition makes it difficult to scale or modify system components without major restructuring.

## 1.8 Why are caches useful, what problems do they solve, and what problems can they cause?

- **Usefulness**:
  1. **Speed**: Accessing data from a cache is faster than accessing it from main memory or a slower device (e.g., disk).  
  2. **Reduced latency**: Caches decrease the average time to access data, improving system performance.  

- **Problems solved**:  
  - They bridge the speed gap between fast processors and slower memory or storage, providing more efficient data access.  

- **Problems caused**:  
  - **Complexity** in keeping the cache consistent with the underlying storage (cache coherence issues).  
  - **Cost** of large or multiple caches can be high, and poor cache design can lead to suboptimal performance gains.  

- **Why not make the cache as large as the device itself?**  
  - **Cost and practicality**: Large caches are expensive in terms of memory technology.  
  - **Complexity**: Managing a massive cache can be more complex than simply using the underlying device.  
  - **Diminishing returns**: Beyond a certain size, the performance gains might not justify the added cost and complexity.
